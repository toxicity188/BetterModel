## 📗 Notice
Due to Mojang’s [new version numbering system](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-new-version-numbering-system) (e.g., 1.21.x → 26.x), the next BetterModel feature release will begin at `2.0.0` to avoid confusion with Minecraft versions.  
This also marks the completion of the BetterModel 1.x series, as its core APIs and features have now reached a stable, finalized state.

Several technical questions are expected to emerge in the near future, and they may influence the evolution of BetterModel 2.0.0:

- Will Mojang upgrade Minecraft’s Java requirement to [version 25](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/25/)?
- Will Spigot platform compatibility be phased out based on [future policy decisions by the Paper team](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper/pull/13135#issuecomment-3368037505)?
- How will NMS be organized under Mojang’s new version numbering system?

BetterModel.model("model").ifPresent(model -> model.create(location, ModelProfile.of(player)));
