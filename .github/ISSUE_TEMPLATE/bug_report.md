**Required**  
I required some help to provide you a correct solution.

1. Tell me the detail about your problem.
2. Upload some screenshot or text log related to your issue. such as:
- Error log
- In-game screen
- Your yml config
- Your resource
3. Remember to notice your environment
- OS(windows/mac/etc)
- Server version(1.21.5/etc)
- Server platform(Spigot/Paper/Folia/Purpur/etc)

**Disclaimer**  
I do NOT provide any solution about that.

- Outdated BetterModel
- Using informal launcher such as Feather client
